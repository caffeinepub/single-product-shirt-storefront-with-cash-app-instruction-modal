There is insufficient evidence in the provided diff summary that REQ-8 (removal/non-display of the specific email address) was addressed across all UI strings, including the Cash App instructions modal.",

      "reason": "The diff summary shows changes in App.tsx plus metadata/state files, but does not show any removals/edits of user-facing strings where the email might exist (especially in CashAppInstructionsModal). Without seeing modifications to the modal or other text locations, we cannot confirm the email was removed or is not rendered.",
