# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a single-page storefront to sell one shirt for $25, showing front/back product photos and providing a “Buy Now” modal with manual Cash App payment instructions.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a single visible product page for the shirt with price shown as "$25" and a primary "Buy Now" button.
- Add a simple product photo viewer (gallery/carousel or selectable thumbnails) using the two uploaded images exactly as provided for front/back views.
- Implement a "Buy Now" popup modal that instructs users to send $25 to Cash App cashtag "$bslimeballin", states the shirt will be sent after payment is received, and supports closing via UI control(s) and Escape.
- Apply a cohesive streetwear-appropriate visual theme (consistent palette, typography, spacing) across the page and modal, responsive for mobile.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can view the shirt (front and back), see the $25 price, and click “Buy Now” to open a modal showing how to manually pay $25 via Cash App to $bslimeballin and that the product ships after payment is received.
