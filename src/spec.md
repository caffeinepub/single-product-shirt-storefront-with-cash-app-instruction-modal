# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the storefront product to be labeled as a preorder and change the displayed price to $45 everywhere in the UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Update all UI price displays from "$25" to "$45" on the product page.
- Update the Cash App instructions modal to show "$45" in every place the amount appears (including any reminder/note text).
- Add a visible "Preorder" label on the product page and adjust the primary purchase call-to-action wording to reflect preorder status.

**User-visible outcome:** The product page shows the item as a preorder with a $45 price, and the Cash App instructions consistently reference a $45 payment amount.
