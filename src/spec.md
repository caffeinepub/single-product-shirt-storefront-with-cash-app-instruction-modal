# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Show an updates notice at the very top of the storefront on first load and ensure the email address is not displayed anywhere in the UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a top-of-page notice above the existing header on the main storefront (single product page) with the exact text: “Customers will receive updates when the product drops and when their preorder has been shipped.”
- Remove the string “sincerelykilla@icloud.com” from all user-facing frontend UI locations (including header, main content, footer, and the Cash App instructions modal).

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors immediately see the updates notice at the top of the storefront, and no email address is shown anywhere on the site.
